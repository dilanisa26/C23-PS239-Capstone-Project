# VitalityAI: Mobile Application for Fitness and Health Consultation

## Overview

VitalityAI is a mobile application developed by us for our capstone project in Bangkit Academy, led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka. The app offers a unique combination of Machine Learning-powered features, including an NLP chatbot for fitness and health consultation using LSTM deep learning and a computer vision task to assess the form of squat and deadlift exercises using a Random Forest model. Although the project still needs further improvement, our team has made significant progress in collecting the dataset, building the models, deploying them, creating a user-friendly UI/UX for the mobile app, and integrating the models seamlessly.

## Features

The VitalityAI mobile application offers the following key features:

1. **NLP Chatbot for Fitness and Health Consultation:** The NLP chatbot utilizes LSTM deep learning to provide personalized fitness and health consultation to users. Users can interact with the chatbot, receive guidance, and access expert advice on their fitness journey.

2. **Computer Vision Exercise Form Assessment:** The app incorporates a computer vision task that uses a Random Forest model to classify the form of squat and deadlift exercises. Users can receive real-time feedback on whether their exercises are correctly performed, aiding them in maintaining proper form and reducing the risk of injuries.

## Dataset Collection

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was collecting the dataset manually from scratch. Our dedicated team curated a diverse dataset for both the NLP chatbot and the computer vision model. This comprehensive dataset ensures the effectiveness and accuracy of the machine learning models.

## Model Development and Deployment

We used TensorFlow and Keras to build the LSTM deep learning model for the NLP chatbot and implemented the Random Forest model for the computer vision task. After training the models, we deployed them to the mobile application, making them readily accessible to users.

## Mobile App UI/UX

The VitalityAI mobile application boasts a user-friendly UI/UX design to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for users. The intuitive interface allows users to navigate effortlessly through the app and interact with the chatbot and exercise form assessment features.

## Collaboration and Acknowledgments

VitalityAI is the result of a collaborative effort with Bangkit Academy, Google, GoTo, and Traveloka. We are grateful for the support and mentorship provided by these organizations throughout the development of this project.

## Future Improvements

While the project has made remarkable progress, we recognize that there is still room for improvement. In the future, we plan to enhance the chatbot's capabilities, fine-tune the computer vision model for more accurate exercise form assessment, and add additional features to cater to various fitness needs.
